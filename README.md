# Conversion-Rate-Prediction-for-E-Commerce-Marketplace
This project analyzes conversion, a key lower-funnel metric, in advertising and user behavior data. We explore conversion rates across user/advertiser segments and build models to predict conversion likelihood based on behavioral or demographic features.

1. Cleaned and processed 310k transaction records using Pandas and SQL; applied outlier filtering and one-hot encoding.
2. Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers; addressed class imbalance using stratified sampling.
3. Evaluated model performance with 10-fold cross-validation; achieved AUC of 0.84 (LogReg) and 0.95 (RF).
4. Ranked feature importance and proposed user segmentation to improve personalized marketing strategies.
